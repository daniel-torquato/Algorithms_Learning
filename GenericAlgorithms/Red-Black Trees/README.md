# Properties
	1. Every node is either red or black
	2. The root is black
	3. Every leaf (NULL) is black
	4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
	5. For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves
	   contain the same number of black nodes.

# Theorem
13.1.
	A red-black tree with n internal nodes has height at most 2log(n+1)
